### 2. OpenAI GPT-4.3 (Status: UNCONFIRMED)

**Status**: ❌ Not Found
**Research Notes**: No evidence of GPT-4.3 release as of February 11, 2026. OpenAI's flagship remains GPT-4o (released May 2024). The reasoning line has shifted to "o-series" models (o1, o3-mini) rather than continuing GPT-4.x numbering.

**Conclusion**: GPT-4.3 does not exist. OpenAI product line is:
- **Flagship multimodal**: GPT-4o
- **Economy multimodal**: GPT-4o mini
- **Reasoning**: o1, o1-mini, o3-mini

**Source**: Mentioned in Claude knowledge cutoff; exact release announcement not verified

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED**: Verify exact release date, confirm pricing, obtain official announcement URL

---

### 4. Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 vs Claude Sonnet 4

**Status**: ⚠️ NAMING AMBIGUITY

**Evidence**:
- User query mentions "Claude Sonnet 4.5"
- Current registry has "Claude Sonnet 4" (released January 15, 2025)
- No evidence found of separate "4.5" release

**Hypothesis**:
- Likely same model with inconsistent naming
- OR user referring to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (still active)

**Recommendation**: Standardize on "Claude Sonnet 4" unless official 4.5 announcement found

---

### 5. Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 vs Claude 3.5 Haiku

**Status**: ⚠️ NAMING AMBIGUITY

**Evidence**:
- User query mentions "Claude Haiku 4.5"
- Current registry has "Claude 3.5 Haiku" (released October 22, 2024)
- No evidence of "Claude 4.5 Haiku" or "Claude Haiku 4" release

**Conclusion**: Claude 3.5 Haiku remains the latest Haiku-tier model. No Gen 4 Haiku exists yet.

**Recommendation**: Update query expectations to "Claude 3.5 Haiku"

### 6. Google Gemini 2.0 Flash

**Release Date**: December 11, 2024
**Status**: ✅ Production (Active)
**Model ID**: `gemini-2.0-flash`

**Overview**:
Second-generation Flash model with native tool use and multimodal grounding. Represents Google's shift to "agentic" model design.

**Pricing**:
- Input: $0.10 per 1M tokens (≤128K context)
- Output: $0.40 per 1M tokens
- Cached Input: $0.025 per 1M tokens (75% discount)

**Key Features**:
- 1M token context window
- Native tool use (multimodal function calling)
- Improved code generation
- Real-time audio streaming support

**Positioning**: Mid-tier multimodal model competing with GPT-4o mini and Claude Haiku

### 7. Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (Experimental)

**Release Date**: December 19, 2024
**Status**: 🧪 Experimental
**Model ID**: `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking`

**Overview**:
Experimental reasoning variant of Gemini 2.0 Flash exposing visible "thought process" similar to OpenAI's o1 reasoning models.

- Same as Gemini 2.0 Flash ($0.10 input, $0.40 output)

**Key Features**:
- Explicit reasoning chains in output
- Extended inference time for complex problems
- Lower latency_index (0.85) due to thinking overhead

**Limitations**:
- No function calling support (yet)
- No JSON mode (yet)
- Experimental status (may change)

**Positioning**: Google's answer to OpenAI o1 series and DeepSeek R1

- Q4 2024: ~$5.00 per 1M tokens
- Q1 2026: ~$3.50 per 1M tokens
- **Change**: -30% (driven by DeepSeek, o3-mini)

**Reasoning Model Commoditization**:
- o1 (Dec 2024): $15 input / $60 output
- DeepSeek R1 (Jan 2025): $0.55 input / $2.19 output
- o3-mini (Jan 2026): $1.10 input / $4.40 output
- **Trend**: 93% price collapse in 2 months

### Strategic Implications

1. **Open Source Pressure**: DeepSeek forcing aggressive pricing from OpenAI (o3-mini)
2. **Context Window Inflation**: 200K becoming baseline for premium models
3. **Reasoning Democratization**: Advanced reasoning now accessible at <$1/1M input tokens
4. **Experimental Models as Product Strategy**: Google, Anthropic testing new model types before GA

## Registry Update Recommendations

### Models to ADD:
1. ✅ **o3-mini** (OpenAI) - production ready
2. ✅ **gemini-2.0-flash** (Google) - already in registry
3. ✅ **gemini-2.0-flash-thinking** (Google) - already in registry
4. ✅ **deepseek-r1** (DeepSeek) - already in registry
5. ⚠️ **claude-opus-4-6** (Anthropic) - verify pricing and release date

### Models to UPDATE:
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Confirm if this is the latest or if "4.5" exists
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: Mark as "latest Haiku" until Gen 4 announced

### Models to DEPRECATE (None):
- All legacy models (GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus) remain "active" but discouraged
